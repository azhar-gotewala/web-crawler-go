# Distributed Web Crawler Project

## Project Overview
Build a concurrent web crawler that demonstrates advanced Golang concurrency patterns, focusing on:
- Goroutines
- Channels
- Synchronization
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Crawler Structure
**Objectives:**
- Create a basic web crawler that fetches web pages
- Implement goroutines for concurrent fetching
- Use channels for communication between goroutines

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Create a URL queue mechanism
- [ ] Implement concurrent URL fetching
- [ ] Add basic error handling
- [ ] Limit concurrent requests

### Stage 2: Advanced Concurrency Patterns
**Objectives:**
- Implement worker pool pattern
- Add rate limiting
- Manage shared resources safely

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Create a worker pool for URL processing
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown
- [ ] Add context for cancellation
- [ ] Use sync.WaitGroup for coordination

### Stage 3: Data Processing and Storage
**Objectives:**
- Extract and process web page content
- Store processed data concurrently
- Implement thread-safe data storage

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Create concurrent data storage mechanism
- [ ] Implement content extraction
- [ ] Add mutex or channel-based synchronization
- [ ] Create result aggregation method

### Stage 4: Performance Optimization
**Objectives:**
- Benchmark crawler performance
- Optimize memory and CPU usage
- Implement intelligent crawling strategies

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Add performance profiling
- [ ] Implement URL deduplication
- [ ] Create depth-limited crawling
- [ ] Optimize goroutine management

### Advanced Challenge
Extend the crawler to support:
- Distributed crawling across multiple machines
- Persistent storage of crawled data
- Advanced filtering and content analysis

## Key Golang Concepts to Master
